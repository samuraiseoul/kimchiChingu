To say 'verb but...', change the verb into it's [stem form]({{site.baseurl}}/book/verbs/stem/)
and add '는데' or '지만'. The difference between the two is that 지만, highlights the
more conflicting or opposing nature of what follows it.

### Examples:

| Dictionary | English | 는데 | 지만 |
| 생기다 | to occur  | 생기는데 | 생기지만 |
| 죽이다 | to kill | 죽이는데 | 죽이지만 |
| 바라다 | to hope for | 바라는데 | 바라지만 |
