Korean verbs and adjectives often form the main meaning in a sentence by use of
appending one or more endings to the verb stem or conjugate form. Most endings
also end in '다' and are therefore verbs or adjectives themselves and can be
conjugated again to add another ending on to them. There are a few endings which
have a prefix form as well and are covered in the section where the ending shows.
