To change verbs into the negative form, there are two ways. One is to change the
verb into the [stem form]({{site.baseurl}}/book/verbs/stem/) and add '지않다'.
The second is to add '안' to the beginning of the verb. A general rule to follow
of which to use, is to use the prefix when a verb will only have one more basic
conjugation, and the suffix when it will have many conjugations.

### Examples:

| Dictionary | English | Suffix | Prefix |
| 먹다 | to eat | 먹지않다 | 안먹다 |
| 하다 | to do | 하지않다 | 안하다 |
| 밉다 | to hate | 밉지않다 | 안밉다 |
