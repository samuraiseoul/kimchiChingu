To say 'because verb...', change the verb into it's [stem form]({{site.baseurl}}/book/verbs/stem/)
and add '으니까' or '니까'. If the stem ends in a consonant, add '으니까', and if it ends
in a vowel, add '니까'. Alternatively change the verb into it's [conjugate form]({{site.baseurl}}/book/verbs/conjugate/)
and add '서'.
