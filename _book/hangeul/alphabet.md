Korea's alphabet is known as Hangeul and is a phonetic alphabet composed
of 30 letters, 19 consonants and 21 vowels. In Korean the consonants and vowels
are arranged into syllable blocks. In this section we will be going over the sounds
of the letters.

### Consonants:

| ㄱ | ㄲ | ㅋ | ㄷ | ㄸ | ㅌ |
| g | gg | k | d | dd | t |
| ㅂ | ㅃ | ㅍ | ㅈ | ㅉ | ㅊ | ㅅ | ㅆ |
| b | bb | p | j | jj | ch | s | ss |
| ㅇ | ㄴ | ㄹ | ㅁ | ㅎ |
| -/ng | n | r/l | m | h |

Many consonants come in threes such as ㄱ. You can see in the table that it has
two other relatives, ㄲ and ㅋ. This makes similar sounds easy to remember as the
 difference is just one stroke. There are two special characters up there as well,   
 ㅇ and ㄹ. ㅇ is a silent consonant if it comes at the beginning of a syllable block
 and an 'ng' sound at the end of one. ㄹ is more of an 'R' sound at the beginning
 of a block and more of an 'L' at the end.


### Vowels:

| ㅏ | ㅑ | ㅓ | ㅕ | ㅣ |
| a | ya | eo | yeo | i |
| ㅐ | ㅒ | ㅔ | ㅖ |  |
| ae | yae | e | ye |  |
| ㅜ | ㅠ | ㅗ | ㅛ | ㅡ |
| oo | yoo | o | yo | eu |

 In addition to these 14 base vowels there are also 7 compound vowels:

 | ㅘ | ㅚ | ㅙ |
 | wa | oe | wae |
 | ㅝ | ㅞ | ㅟ |
 | weo | we | wi |  
 | ㅢ |
 | eui |

Two vowels that many people have a hard time pronouncing the difference on are
ㅐ and ㅔ. The first one, ㅐ, sounds like the letter "A" or the "A" in "Yay!".
The second one, ㅔ, is pronounced like "eh" similar to the "ay" in "say" <span class="japanify">or like え in Japanese</span>.
