For verbs and adjectives ending in ㅏ conjugating is quite easy because it's the same as the
stem form! Nothing else is necessary to conjugate it. The only exceptions are
words ending in 하. Their conjugation rules can be found
[here]({{site.baseurl}}/book/verbs/conjugate-hada/).

### Examples:

| Dictionary | English | Stem | Conjugate Form |
