Korean verbs are found in their dictionary form, meaning they end in '다'.
Verbs in the dictionary form can not be used 'as is' and must
be changed into their conjugate form. Korean adjectives follow the same
conjugation rules as verbs, however, are not always found in their dictionary form
when looked up. If they are found already conjugated they must first
be conjugated back into their dictionary form to be used if the desired ending
requires use of the stem form.

In addition to being able to be used in their conjugate form, verbs and adjectives can be
changed into their stem or conjugate form and take on a variety
of endings or prefixes to change the overall meaning of the sentence.
These verb endings can stack upon each other to give the sentence a much deeper
meaning or be used to combine clauses to express more complex concepts.
