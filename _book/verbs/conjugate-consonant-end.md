Verb and adjective stems ending with consonants are the most abundant type of stem ending. For
words ending in a constant you simply add an 아 or an 어 to the end of the stem,
depending on the vowel in the last syllable of the stem. If the vowel is an ㅏ
or an ㅗ, add 아, and if it's an ㅜ or an ㅓ, add 어.

### Examples:

| 먹다 | to eat | 먹 | 먹어 |
| 줏다 | to die | 죽 | 죽어 |
| 놀다 | to play | 놀 | 놀아 |
| 닫다 | to close | 닫 | 닫아 |
