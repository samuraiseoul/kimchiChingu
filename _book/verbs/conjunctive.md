The conjunctive form, like the [stem form]({{site.baseurl}}/book/verbs/stem/) of
a verb can't live on it's on and requires one of the verb endings listed below to
function. It however is an easy form to conjugate. First conjugate the verb to the
[stem form]({{site.baseurl}}/book/verbs/stem/), if it ends in a vowel or 'ㄹ' it is
already in the conjunctive form, otherwise just add '으'to put it in the conjunctive
form.

### Examples:

| English Verb | Dictionary Form | Stem Form |
| to do | 하다 | 하 |
| to search | 찾다 | 찾으 |
| to play | 놀다 | 놀 |
