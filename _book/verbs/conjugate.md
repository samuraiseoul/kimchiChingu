The most complicated form to put verbs and adjectives into is the conjugate form.
The conjugate form starts off by changing the verb or adjective into the
[stem form]({{site.baseurl}}/book/verbs/stem/). Once in its stem form, how to change it
depends on the last remaining syllable block in the word. There are 9 different
rules for making the conjugate form, and they all depend on the last vowel and
syllable block in a word's stem form.
