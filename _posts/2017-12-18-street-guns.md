I'm a fan of this group, Street Guns, as it's a great example of a hard to find
genre in Korean music, rockabilly, or kimchibilly. I'm glad there are musicians
in Korea who break from the norm, and try out genres that aren't popular, and
the street guns nail the genre pretty well I think!


I was also lucky enough to learn a piece of grammar from this song too! Add
서야 to the 고 form of a verb, and it changes that verbs meaning to
'Only after verb'. So for instance, '피자를 처음 먹고서야 사람들이 왜 좋아하는지 알았어',
'Only after I had pizza for the first time, did I understand why people like it.'
